# PES VCS (Version Control System)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a simplified version of a Version Control System (like Git), implemented as part of the PES University lab. It supports basic version control operations such as initializing a repository, adding files, committing changes, and viewing commit history.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Initialize repository (`pes init`)
- Add files to staging area (`pes add`)
- Create commits (`pes commit`)
- View commit history (`pes log`)
- Object storage system
- Tree structure for file snapshots

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- GCC Compiler
- Makefile

## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1: Compile
```bash
